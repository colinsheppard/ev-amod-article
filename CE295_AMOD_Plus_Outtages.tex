% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.



% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

The era of fully autonomous, electrified taxi fleets is rapidly approaching, and with it the opportunity to innovate myriad on-demand services that extend beyond the realm of human mobility. This project envisions a future where autonomous EV fleets can be dispatched as both as a taxi service and a source of on-demand power serving customers during power outages. We develop a PDE-based scheme to manage the optimal dispatch of an autonomous fleet to serve passengers and electric power demand during outages as an additional stream of revenue. We use real world mobility and taxi data from San Francisco for our case study, modeling the optimal dispatch of several fleet sizes over the course of one day; we examine both moderate and extreme outage scenarios. In the moderate scenario, the revenue earned serving power demand is negligible compared with revenue earned serving passenger trips. In the extreme scenario, supplying power accounts for between \$1 and \$2 million, amounting to between 32\% and 40\% more revenue than is earned serving mobility only, depending on fleet size. While the overall value of providing on-demand power depends on the frequency and severity of power outages, our results show that serving power demand during large-scale outages can provide a substantial value stream, comparable to the value to be earned providing grid services.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation and Background}
Fully autonomous plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) have tremendous potential to change the future of mobility. In particular, fleets of autonomous vehicles providing on-demand mobility services will likely play a major role in transportation systems \cite{litman_2015}. While the impact of these changes on travel demand is uncertain, it is clear that safety, energy efficiency, and cost of travel will be substantially improved in the future. It is also clear that autonomous on-demand fleets of PEVs will require continued innovation in methods for systems optimization and control.

Autonomous PEV fleets could play an important role in providing flexibility services to the future electric grid. Another potential source of ancillary value provided by these vehicles is supplying electricity to buildings during power outages, when occupants are willing to pay more for energy to avoid damages associated with lack of electric service. The current work examines the additional revenue attained by a fleet of autonomous electric vehicles providing both a mobility-on-demand service and backup power during outages.

\subsection{Relevant Literature}
The current personal vehicle ownership paradigm involves gross under-utilization of vehicles, as personal vehicles sit idle for most of the day. This under-utilization makes grid-connected PEV batteries an excellent source of load flexibility by charging or discharging as needed while vehicles are not in use. Numerous studies examine the capabilities \cite{lefloch_pde_2016, lefloch_pde_2015, ota_autonomous_v2g, behrouz_2014} and economics \cite{cpuc_2016, sheppard_bae_2015, ota_autonomous_v2g} of using electric vehicles to provide grid services. However, Sheppard and Bae conclude that privately owned vehicles can earn only about \$100 per year (on average) providing ancillary services \cite{sheppard_bae_2015}. 

Furthermore, technology development and gradual deployment of semi-autonomous safety features suggest that the future of transportation is autonomous. Once autonomous vehicles are deployed at scale, the current paradigm of personal vehicle ownership is likely to change \cite{litman_2015}. Although a right-sized, autonomous, commercially operated fleet is likely to be much less flexible than privately owned vehicles, centralized control can increase the magnitude and reliability of aggregate response when price signals for battery charging or discharging are adequate. 

\subsection{Focus of this Study}

We propose a PDE-based approach, described in \cite{lefloch_pde_2016}, to simulate the optimal dispatch of autonomous on-demand PEVs serving time varying, spatially distributed demand for trips and backup power. The fleet is dispatched to maximize profit earned from serving both trips and power. The revenue earned for each trip serviced or kWh provided depends on the origin and destination of the trip, and the location of the power outage. We consider several fleet sizes, examining differences in vehicle dispatch, state of charge, revenue earned, and unserved demand for trips/power. Key contributions of this work include the geospatial modeling of vehicle mobility, charging \& discharging, and inclusion of backup power as an ancillary revenue stream.

\end{table}

We adopt and extend the scheme developed by \cite{lefloch_pde_2016} for tracking and controlling an aggregation of electric vehicles. The core advantage of the scheme is the recognition that in an autonomous PEV fleet, only the location of vehicles and their state of charge are critical to know at any point in time. Instead of representing individual vehicles explicitly and developing a combinatorial approach to control, we aggregate all vehicles in a node and represent the aggregate distribution of vehicle state of energy (SOE). Vehicles in any node $i$ can be in one of three states: charging, idle, or discharging, which we represent by the state variables $u_i(x,t)$, $v_i(x,t)$, and $w_i(x,t)$, respectively. The system is then characterized by the following coupled partial differential equations (see Table \ref{tab:symbols} for further nomenclature):

\begin{eqnarray*}
    \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial t}(x,t) &=& -\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left[ q_C(x) u_i(x,t) \right] + \sigma_{I_i \rightarrow C_i}(x,t) \\
    \frac{\partial v_i}{\partial t}(x,t) &=& \sum_{j\in\mathbb{Z}} \left[ \sigma_{I_i \leftarrow I_j}^\prime(x,t) + \sigma_{I_i \leftarrow I_j}^o(x,t) \right. \\
    & & ~~~ \left. - \sigma_{I_i \rightarrow I_j}^\prime(x,t) - \sigma_{I_i \rightarrow I_j}^o(x,t) \right] \\
    && ~~~ - \sigma_{I_i \rightarrow C_i}(x,t) - \sigma_{I_i \rightarrow D_i}(x,t) \\
    \frac{\partial w_i}{\partial t}(x,t) &=& -\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left[ q_D(x) w_i(x,t) \right] + \sigma_{I_i \rightarrow D_i}(x,t) 
\end{eqnarray*}

Where: 
\begin{eqnarray*}
q_C(x) &=& \frac{7}{E_{max}}\eta\frac{1}{60} \\
q_D(x) &=& \frac{-7}{E_{max}}\frac{1}{60}
\end{eqnarray*}

The equations make use of an advection term (when the time derivative is linearly related to the spatial derivative) to represent how SOE changes over time for vehicles in the charging or discharging states, with SOE advecting toward 1 or 0, respectively. The model is spatially disaggregated, so the three PDEs are repeated for every node in the system and indexed by $i$.

Flow terms $\sigma_{I_i \rightarrow C_i}(x,t)$ and $\sigma_{I_i \rightarrow D_i}(x,t)$ capture the transport of vehicles between the three distributions within each node. Additional flow terms capture transport between the Idle curves of distinct nodes. For a given node $i$ and any other node $j$, four separate terms are used to represent trips with and without passengers ($\sigma^\prime$ and $\sigma^o$ respectively) and departing trips versus arriving trips ($\sigma_{I_i \rightarrow I_j}$ and $\sigma_{I_j \leftarrow I_i}$ respectively).

The inter-nodal flow terms are then constrained through the optimization scheme such that departures from a node $i$ to node $j$ are equivalent to the arrivals of vehicles from $i$ to $j$ at a future time and with a lower SOE, corresponding to the travel time and energy requirements of that trip. The distinction between trips with and without passengers becomes critical in the context of the economic optimization that places monetary value on transporting people over moving empty vehicles.

\subsection{Optimization Formulation}

\subsubsection{Objective}
The objective of the optimization is to maximize the operational profit of dispatching the fleet of autonomous on-demand PEVs:
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \max_{\substack{\sigma_{I_i \rightarrow C_i} \\
    \sigma_{I_i \rightarrow D_i} \\ 
    \sigma_{I_i \rightarrow I_j}}}
    K &=& \sum_{i\in\mathbb{Z}} \int_{t=0}^{T} \left[ \frac{\rho_{dis}(i)}{60} Q_{dis,i}(t) + \right. \\ 
      && \left. \sum_{j\in\mathbb{Z}}\rho_{mob}(i,j)Q_{mob,i,j}(t)  - \frac{C}{60}Q_{ch,i}(t) \right]dt\\
    Q_{dis,i}(t) & = & \int_{0}^{1} 7 w_i(x,t) dx \\
    Q_{ch,i}(t) & = & \int_{0}^{1} 7 u_i(x,t) dx \\
    Q_{mob,i,j}(t) & = & \int_{0}^{1}\left( \sigma_{I_i \rightarrow I_j}^\prime(x,t) \right)dx
\end{eqnarray*}
Where $\rho_{mob}(i,j)$, $\rho_{dis}(i)$, and $C$ are the fares charged to passengers, the price charged to serve load during outages, and the cost to purchase electricty from the grid, respecitvely. The constant 60 converts kWh to kW-minutes and the constant 7 is the charging and discharging rate of each vehicle.

\subsubsection{Constraints}

The equations of state are discretized using a first-order upwind scheme for numerically solving hyperbolic PDEs. They appear in the formulation as a set of equality constraints. In addition to the equations of state there are other constraints on the flows which we use to enforce realistic transport between nodes and the overall conservation of vehicles in the system. 

Firstly, we constrain the size of the flows between states $u$, $v$, and $w$ to be no greater than the number of vehicles in those states:

\begin{eqnarray*}
    -\sigma_{I_i \rightarrow C_i}(x,t) & \le & u_i(x,t) / \Delta t \\
  \left\{ \sigma_{I_i \rightarrow C_i}(x,t) + \sigma_{I_i \rightarrow D_i}(x,t) \right. && \\
  + \sigma_{I_i \rightarrow I_j}^\prime(x,t) + \sigma_{I_i \rightarrow I_j}^o(x,t) && \\
  \left. - \sigma_{I_i \leftarrow I_j}^\prime(x,t) - \sigma_{I_i \leftarrow I_j}^o(x,t) \right\} & \le & v_i(x,t) / \Delta t \\
    -\sigma_{I_i \rightarrow D_i}(x,t) & \le & w_i(x,t) / \Delta t
\end{eqnarray*}
~\\ 
We also require that as charging vehicles reach an SOE of 1 or as discharging vehicles reach an SOE of 0, they immediately flow to the Idle state.

\begin{eqnarray*}
    -\sigma_{I_i \rightarrow C_i}(1,t) & = & u_i(1,t) / \Delta t \\
    -\sigma_{I_i \rightarrow D_i}(0,t) & = & w_i(0,t) / \Delta t
\end{eqnarray*}

~\\ 
Next, we require that trips be conserved between origin-destination pairs, where arrivals are shifted to a later time step and a lower SOE, based on the time ($\Delta t$) and energy ($\Delta x$) requirements of the trip.

\begin{eqnarray*}
    \sigma_{I_i \rightarrow I_j}^\prime(x,t) & = & \sigma_{I_j \leftarrow I_i}^\prime(x - \Delta x_{i,j},t + \Delta t_{i,j}) \\
     \sigma_{I_i \rightarrow I_j}^o(x,t) & = & \sigma_{I_j \leftarrow I_i}^o(x - \Delta x_{i,j},t + \Delta t_{i,j})
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{equation*}
\{(i,j) \in \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}\} 
\end{equation*}

~\\ 
The values of $\Delta x$ and $\Delta t$ for each node (I, II and IV) are derived empirically based on real San Francisco taxi fare data collected over the course of a month in June 2012. We assume a decline in personal vehicle ownership accompanies deployment of autonomous vehicles. We account for increasing reliance on mobility-on-demand services by scaling travel demand by a factor of 10 relative to 2012. We averaged the measured trip durations and trip distances for trips from each node $i$ to each node $j$, scaling the average distance by 5.05 km/kWh to derive $\Delta x_{i,j}$ and taking the average time as $\Delta t_{i,j}$. The derived values are shown in Table \ref{tab:flow_constraints}.

\end{table}

Vehicle dispatch is constrained such that the number of vehicles servicing passenger trips or power demand cannot exceed mobility and power demand at that time step.

\begin{eqnarray*}
   Q_{dis,i}(t) & \le & D_{dis,i}(t) \\
   Q_{mob,i,j}(t) & \le & D_{mob,i,j}(t) \\
\end{eqnarray*}

The demands $D_{dis,i}$ and $D_{mob,i,j}$ are exogenously defined; derivation of $D_{dis,i}$ is described below. The choice of inequality constraints when constraining $Q_{dis,i}$ and $Q_{mob,i,j}$ serves three purposes: 1) it allows the solution of the optimization to prioritize between serving the two types of demand; 2) it enables simulations where the fleet of vehicles is not sized to meet the peak demand in the system; and 3) it allows the system to be used in an application where power outages occur spontanteously and without foresight.

Finally, we require that the vehicles have sufficient state of energy to make trips:

\begin{eqnarray*}
    \sigma_{I_i \rightarrow I_j}^\prime(x,t) & = & 0, ~~~ x < \Delta x_{i,j} \\
    \sigma_{I_i \rightarrow I_j}^o(x,t) & = & 0, ~~~ x < \Delta x_{i,j}
\end{eqnarray*}

\subsection{Application}

\subsubsection{Spatial Discretization}
We have divided the City of San Francisco, CA into a highly simplified 4-zone, equal-area network (Figure \ref{fig:sf}). As described above, we analyzed taxi data to characterize the constraints realted to mobility and the prices used in the objective. Below we describe how power outages are characterized from real world data. We observe very little demand for mobility and few outages in Node III; due to additional computational complexity of modeling a four node system, we exclude Node III from the current analysis.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{plots/grid1-cropped.png}
  \caption{We divide San Francisco into 4 equal-area nodes. Origins and destinations of taxi trips over one month (June 2012) are plotted as red dots.}
  \label{fig:sf}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Demand for Backup Power}
We estimate the magnitude and location of power outages using real outage data collected from the Pacific Gas \& Electric Company website. These data report the number and spatial ditribution of outages in the region; we aggregate outages spatially by node. We estimate the magnitude of unserved load based on the number of customers affected, expected distribution by customer type (i.e., residential, commercial, industrial), and average power demand by customer type (as reported in EIA form 861). We use local population and economic census data to estimate the distribution of customer types affected by outages in each node.

We examine two days of outage data, including one extreme outage scenario (December 31, 2014) and one moderate outage scenario (September 29, 2014). Figure \ref{fig:power_demand} shows the estimated power demand at each node for both scenarios. We highlight that demand in the Extreme outage scenario exceeds demand in the Moderate outage scenario by two orders of magnitude.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{plots/power_demand.png}
  \caption{Power demand at each node (I, II, IV) in the Moderate (left) and Extreme (right) outage scenarios, reprsented by September 29, 2014 and December 31, 2014, respectively. For readability, demand is presented in kWh in the Moderate scenario, and in MWh in the Extreme scenario.}
  \label{fig:power_demand}
\end{figure}

Finally, we estimate the value of providing backup power on demand. To do so, we compute the cost of damages incurred due to outages in each node for both outage scenarios using the ICE Calculator \cite{ice_calculator_2015}, a tool commonly used by electric utilities to estimate the economic benefits of measures to improve reliability. Inputs for the damage calculations include: time of day/year, the type and size of the affected customers, and the duration of the outage. Table \ref{tab:outage_costs} gives the estimated value of backup power in each node for the two outage scenarios in \$ per unit energy delivered (kWh) and \$ per time step (10 minutes). Although power demand is much higher in the Extreme outages scenario, the cost per kWh is greater in the Moderate outages scenario.

For comparison, Table \ref{tab:trip_costs} lists the fares associated with passenger trips to and from each node in terms of dollars per unit energy consumed (or \$ per time step). These fares are empirically derived from the San Francisco taxi data. The value earned per kWh serving passenger trips is remarkably similar to the value earned per kWh of power demand served.

\section{Results}
We present simulation results for the two outage scenarios with various fleet sizes, including 7,500, 10,000 and 15,000 vehicles for the Moderate outage scenario, and 7,500, 15,000 and 40,000 vehicles for the Extreme outage scenario. The following sections detail the results. We highlight the revenue earned in different scenarios, and differences in dispatch among different fleet sizes.

\subsection{Revenue}
Figure \ref{fig:revenue_bar} presents the revenue earned in each scenario by the entire fleet and per vehicle. Contributors to overall revenue include: the cost to charge (G2V), revenue earned serving trips (Trips), and revenue earned serving power demand (V2B). The total revenue earned (Total) in each scenario and maximum possible revenue (Max) are also shown. The maximum possible revenue includes servicing all passenger trips and all power demand, with no charing costs.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{plots/full_revenue_barchart.png}
  \caption{Revenue earned by entire fleet (left) and per vehicle (right) in the Moderate (top) and Extreme (bottom) outage scenarios. Revenue components include: cost to charge (G2V), revenue earned serving passenger trips (Trips), and revenue earned serving power demand (V2B). The total revenue (Total) and maximum possible revenue (Max) are also shown.}
  \label{fig:revenue_bar}
\end{figure}

Charging costs are almost negligible compared with the revenue earned because the cost of charging (0.25 \$/kWh) is small compared with the revenue earned serving power and trip demand (see Tables \ref{tab:outage_costs} and \ref{tab:trip_costs}).

Next we consider the revenue earned at each node serving power and mobility demand in the Extreme outages scenario, shown in Figure \ref{fig:node_revenue}. Very little revenue is earned at Node I; this is attributable to limited demand for trips and low power demand. Nodes II and IV have higher demand for passenger trips, and experience power outages in the afternoon and morning, respectively.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{plots/aggregated-revenue-by-node.pdf}
  \caption{Revenue earned at each node serving power and mobility demand in the Extreme outages scenario with 7,500, 15,000 and 40,000 vehicle fleets.}
  \label{fig:node_revenue}
\end{figure}

The revenue peaks at Nodes II and IV, coincide with the power outages at those nodes (see Figure \ref{fig:power_demand}). At Node II, the revenue earned per unit time serving power demand (\$11 per 10 minute interval) is marginally higher than the revenue earned puer unit time serving passenger trips. Trips are primarily within node II, and provide \$10 per 10 minute interval. Thus there is only a marginal increase in revenue for the 7,500 fleet during the outage at Node II. We do see a significant increase in revenue during the same outage in the over-sized fleets (15,000 and 40,000 vehicles). At Node IV, the revenue earned serving power demand is \$18 per 10 minute interval, which is considerably more than the revenue to be earned serving passenger trips.

\subsection{Fleet Size and Vehicle Dispatch}
Next we consider the benefits and drawbacks of different fleet sizes. Nearly all demand for mobility and power can be served with a 40,000 vehicle fleet in the Extreme scenario, and a 15,000 vehicle fleet in the Moderate scneario. Figures \ref{fig:time_extreme_40k} and \ref{fig:time_extreme_7500} show the number of vehicles in each state in the Extreme outages scenario with 40,000 and 7500 vehicles. States include: in transit with and without passengers, charging, discharging, and idle. 

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{plots/states-area-40k.pdf}
  \caption{Number of vehicles in each state at each time step in the Extreme outages scenario with a 40,000 vehicle fleet. States include: in transit with and without passengers, charging, discharging, and idle.}
  \label{fig:time_extreme_40k}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{plots/states-area-7500.pdf}
  \caption{Number of vehicles in each state at each time step in the Extreme outages scenario with a 7500 vehicle fleet. States include: in transit with and without passengers, charging, discharging, and idle.}
  \label{fig:time_extreme_7500}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:time_extreme_40k} reveals that a 40,000 vehicle fleet spends most of the simulation in the idle state; the fleet is only fully utilized between 800 and 900 seconds when power demand peaks. Low revenue per vehicle in Figure \ref{fig:revenue_bar} provides further evidence that the 40,000 vehicle fleet is under-utilized. On the other hand, the 7,500 vehicle fleet in Figure \ref{fig:time_extreme_7500} earns less revenue overall, but spends very little time in the idle state. In fact, the vehicles spend more time charging than in any other state; faster charging infrastructure would increase fleet utilization, and should be evaluated as an alternative to increasing the fleet size.

In Figure \ref{fig:node_revenue}, the 7,500 vehicle fleet earns less revenue at Node II than the larger fleets for almost the entire simulation. This result suggests that the 7,500 vehicle fleet is under-sized. Figure \ref{fig:time_moderate_15k} shows the dispatch of a 15,000 vehicle fleet serving mobility only in the Moderate outages scenario. The results indicate that with charging constraints, upwards of 15,000 vehicles are needed to meet all of the demand for mobility.

  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{plots/states-area-moderate-15k.pdf}
  \caption{Number of vehicles in each state at each time step in the Moderate outages scenario with a 15,000 vehicle fleet. States include: in transit with and without passengers, charging, discharging, and idle.}
  \label{fig:time_moderate_15k}
\end{figure}

\section{Discussion}

The fundamental question underlying the current work is whether on-demand backup power provides a substantial value stream for the fleet. To answer that question, we must consider the relative frequency of Extreme and Moderate outage days, and the marginal increase in revenue associated with serving power demand in addition to passenger trips.

We consider several scenarios for the number of Extreme verses Moderate outage days in a year. We then compute the marginal annual revenue earned serving both power and mobility demand, compared with serving mobility only. We treat the Moderate outages sceanrio as a mobility-only case, as the revenue earned serving power demand in that scenario is negligible. 

We calculate the marginal revenue earned serving power demand by taking the difference between a year with Extreme outages and a year with only Moderate outages for equivalent fleet sizes. The results, summarized in Table \ref{tab:annual_scenarios}, suggest that fleet operators can earn \$1400-\$3400 (or $\sim$1-3\%) more revenue per vehicle per year serving power demand during outages, depending on fleet size and the number of major power outages.

These results are sensitive to numerous assumptions in our analysis, including but not limited to: outage cost, outage frequency/duration, vehicle battery size, battery discharge rate, optimization window, and foresight into demand for power and passenger trips.

\subsection{State of Energy}
Figure \ref{fig:soe} shows the aggregate SOE of the fleet with respect to time for the various fleet sizes and outage scenarios. We initialize the fleet with an aggregate SOE of 0.5. For all fleet sizes, the aggregate SOE then drops to below 5\% before any charging occurs. Figures \ref{fig:time_extreme_40k} and \ref{fig:time_extreme_7500} show that charging begins at about 250 and 50 minutes for the 40,000 and 7,500 vehicle fleets, respectively. The entire fleet operates at a very low SOE, cycling out of charging before vehicles reach full SOE. 

The fleet operates at a low SOE because the current model dispatches the fleet based on a planning horizon of only 50 minutes. We assume no knowledge of demand for trips or power more than 50 minutes ahead of time, and assign no penalty for entering the next planning horizon with low SOE. Thus the fleet is dispatched to maximize profit within each 50 minute window, and vehicles spend only as much time charging as is needed to serve near-term demand for trips and power. Furthermore, when vehicles are not needed or have insufficient charge to meet demand within the planning horizon, charging is less cost effective than remaining idle (at zero cost) with low SOE.

Future work will examine more realistic assumptions around vehicle charing. Examples could include a penalty for failing to achieve some minimum SOE at the end of each planning horizon, or a fee charged upon entry into the charging state, incenting vehicles to charge until reaching full SOE.

\section{Summary}
We demonstrate a method for simulating a fleet of autonomous PEVs in San Francisco dispatched to serve mobility and electricity demand during power outages throughout the city. We use a PDE-based approach to model the aggregate state of energy of the fleet as vehicles charge, discharge, and travel throughout the system. We optimize vehicle dispatch over a 50 minute planning horizon, assuming perfect foresight into both mobility and power demand within that time frame. We consider two outage scenarios, including both Moderate and Extreme outages based on real outage data for San Francisco. Finally, we compute the revenue earned in each scenario with various fleet sizes, ranging from 7,500 to 40,000 vehicles. We find that serving power demand increase fleet revenue by \$1400-\$3400 per vehicle, or 30-40\%, in the Extreme outages scenario. Given that power outages are rare, these results translate to $\sim$1-3\% more revenue per year, depending on the number of major power outages in a year.

%The charging rate defined by $P(x)$ is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:dcFastRate}. The function is assumed to be piecewise linear and it rapidly transforms after an SOC of 80\% from a fast charge to a Level 2 charge (7kW) and then declines again to a trickle charge at an SOC of 95\%.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}

%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline

%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals use top floats exclusively.
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals, places footnotes above bottom
% floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat command of the
% stfloats package.



% \section{Conclusion}





% if have a single appendix:
%\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]
% or
%\appendix  % for no appendix heading
% do not use \section anymore after \appendix, only \section*
% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
% \subsection or using \label (\appendices by itself
% starts a section numbered zero.)
%


% \appendices
% \section{Proof of the First Zonklar Equation}
% Some text for the appendix.

% your own custom macro containing the \includegraphics command to make things
% simpler here.)
